## "Normies" Internet?

The word "normie" often sounds condescending and arrogant to me, but this is
probably a good description of most Internet users. If you ask them what is the
Internet, they will (probably) answer with Google or even Twitter and Facebook.
Sometimes I think people just do not know what is the difference between a
search engine and the Internet.

The reason why people mix up these things is that they have never accessed
the Web without a search engine. Unfortunately I am one of them. I remember
using Google Chrome and Google Search since I am a kid before the word
"privacy" entered my dictionary.

## Internet Without Search Engines

A few days ago I was searching for some programming textbooks, but I found a
peculiar book instead. I already forgot the name of it, but the content goes
like this: a curated list of websites with brief introduction. They even rated
the websites with "usefulness", "entertainment" and whatever. I guess the book
is a bit dated since those websites either change completely or are down. That
book was published in the late 90s, which confirms my prediction.

Publishing books about specific websites -- that is not something I have ever
thought before. Those times, I missed all the great moments of computing! Every
time I see those printed UNIX man pages on some 80s programming books, they are
nostalgic, but I have never experienced them! At the same time, I feel lucky not
to have computers with bad computing powers. I guess we lose and gain a lot of
things when the world advances (or is it?).

At the 90s, people do not have search engines. To promote their websites, they
do not carry out "search engine optimization" (also known as spamming meta tags
and keywords). They simply ask others to list their website in books, or their
websites! Is this what the inventors of "hypertext documents" want to achieve?
People go to different pages by clicking on those blue anchor tags but not
typing into search bars. The website nowadays do not really link others. They
are competitors and not companions, struggling to rise to the top of
GOOGLE dot com.

## The Worse Thing About Search Engines

Those SEO experts hired by big organizations have pushed the most useless
websites to the top of every search engine. When you are searching for
"controversial people", you have to expect the first page are all CNN,
Washington Post, New York Times etc. Small but valuable sites are sink to the
bottom because they cannot manipulate search engines like those giants. Of
course the modern Web has tons of data, but how many of them are useable?

Maybe I should not blame those search engines, but people who write bloated and
meaningless websites.

I have not started "rejecting the modern Web" but throughout the years I like
browsers, websites and technology less and less. The most pathetic thing is that
there is no remedy -- who can change the mess created by irresponsible
programmers? This is getting more and more off-topic. I should end my rant here.
